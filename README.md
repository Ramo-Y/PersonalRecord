# Description
With this app you can track all your personal records and have a good overview of your progress. Define your own movements and add the maximum values achieved. A feature for workouts will follow soon.

# Usage
## Overview
![Overview](./.github/images/feature_graphic.png)

## General information
### OS
It is currently implemented for Android and published on the Play Store.

### Themes
There is a dark and a light theme, it is automatically adapted to the system theme.

### Data and storage
The settings are saved as preferences and the data in the app folder. This means that the data is transferred to the new device with a backup/restore. Synchronization between multiple devices is currently not supported.

## Burger menu
<img src="./.github/images/burger_menu_view.png" alt="Burger menu" style="width:250px;"/>

The burger button at the top left takes you to the settings. You can also report a problem, go to the project page, go to the project sponsorship page or share the app. At the bottom is the button with the version, where you can see detailed information about this version and the technology.

## Movements
<img src="./.github/images/movements_view.png" alt="Movements" style="width:250px;"/>

To add movement records, you must first define your movements. By pressing the add button, a new line is added in which you can name your movement. Movements can only be deleted, as long as they are not in use.

## All movement records
<img src="./.github/images/all_movement_records_view.png" alt="All movement records" style="width:250px;"/>

In this menu you can enter all your records with a date, weight and movement. This is the overview to see them all, they are sorted by the name of the movement and then the most recent movements at the top. New entries can be added with the add button and deleted with the trash button.

## Movement record maxes
<img src="./.github/images/movement_record_maxes_view.png" alt="Movement record maxes" style="width:250px;"/>

This is an overview screen in which all maximum values for the respective movement are displayed. New entries can also be added here.

## Settings
<img src="./.github/images/settings_view.png" alt="Settings" style="width:250px;"/>

### Unit
The unit is a free text field and is only used for display purposes. No conversions take place when changing.

### Date format
You can use a format identifier to specify how your date format should be displayed. For example, yyyy-MM-dd (ISO 8601 Date Format) displays the date as follows: 2023-12-31. See the [standard date and time format specifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings#table-of-format-specifiers). Invalid inputs can lead to the date no longer being displayed correctly.

### Language
The language can be changed and will be applied directly after saving. New languages can be added, see also [translations and languages](#translations-and-languages) for more information.
